# Learning Library Management System

This repository contains a small Java-based project built on Spring MVC, Spring Core, and Thymeleaf, with a MySQL database backend. The project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in developing a library management system with Spring Framework and Thymeleaf Templating Engine.

## Key Features:

1. **Spring MVC**: Utilizes the powerful Spring MVC framework for handling HTTP requests and responses, providing a robust structure for building web applications.
2. **Spring Core**: Leverages the core features of the Spring framework for dependency injection and inversion of control, ensuring modular and maintainable code.
3. **Thymeleaf Templating Engine**: Integrates Thymeleaf, a modern server-side Java template engine for web and standalone environments, enabling elegant and flexible UI development.
4. **MySQL Database**: Utilizes MySQL as the backend database to store and manage library data efficiently.
5. **Models**: The project includes two main models, namely Member and Book, representing the entities within the library system.

## Functionality:

1. **CRUD Operations**: Implements Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for both Member and Book entities, allowing seamless management of library resources.
2. **User Interfac**e: Provides very easy user interface for interacting with the library system, built using Thymeleaf templates and Spring MVC controllers.

This project serves as a practical learning resource for understanding and implementing essential concepts of web application development using Java, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, and MySQL.
